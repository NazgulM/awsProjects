Create bucket --> AWS region choose which region is close to you, granting public access is not good idea, AWS makes default to block all public access, bucket versioning, possible recover all versions, all videos, files, by default is turned off, tags can help to easily track costs.
Then server side encryption is disabled by default, advanced setting should be disabled to lock, click create Bucket, and it will show success.
